Notes for Prutimer_IEP

Hardware:

Beaglebone Black A5
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
5v 2amp power supply

Software:

Debian 7-16, bone60
gcc

Texas Instruments "am335x_pru_package-master"
pasm (PRUSS assembler)

Hardware connections:

5v from power supply to VCC on HC-SR04 and pin P9.06
GND from power supply to GND on HC-SR04 and GND on the BBB
pin p9.12 on BBB to trigger on HC-SR04 (worked without level shifting)
pin p8.15 on BBB will go to echo on HC-SR04 BUT NEEDS LEVEL SHIFTING. 

Devicetree:

prujts-00A0.dts - enables the PRUSS and configures P8.15 (ofset 0x3c) for PRU input.

Program:

pi.c - initializes the PRU, controls gpio P9.12 as the trigger using SYSFS.  Sends pulse to HC-SR04
         and waits for PRU signal, then reads the PRU0 data memory and computes and prints the
        distance.

pi.p - waits for the pulse to go high, starts the IEP counter,  waits for the pulse to go low, stops the
          IEP counter, moves the IEP count to PRU0 local data memory, clears the count and sends signal
          to Linux.


This example is almost identical to the Prutimer example.  The two timers give identical results.
